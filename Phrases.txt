The information I get
Started to discuss aligning activities (meeting structure, communication channels, repsonsibilities, tools)
What is your timeline
Getting your point, the key is

What is not clear 
A pretty good state is reached
if time permits
from xy point of view it is pretty easy
Up and running / rampng up / learning curve
Can't procees without having
Business logic behind
there is a potential / alternatives
deeply involved
collaborate
it is a big thing, we are on a same boat
synchornize activities
proven delepoing paradigm
The thing is

Theoretically speaking
What is the takeaway
ARE YOU UP TO

let me set the context
First I would like to spend 2 minutes to share my vision where we are, what is ahed and what would i expect to be discussed
we have sg to discuss
it is sg need to be spent a time on | we have sg to discuss | it would be great to be implemented

moving from to can we spent a few minutes with?
Ended up
pracitcally speaking
paradigm change
letj jump right into in

Please reach out to the DANF team (e.g. in comment under this post) if you have concerns or need support to adapt to the new schema.
We will keep you updated regarding the timeline.
but this is just the foundation for this feature, we have to figure out how to give everyone the power without too much freedom that would result wild west in the DANF db
let me check, do not have anything prepared

As you know, we have been working on the new perfume that we are launching in April and we are unsure about some of the packaging details. We have seen some of your creative work in the sales department and we think you have a very good eye for detail.
Do you have some time before close of business this Friday to sit down with us and talk through some of our designs? We would truly appreciate your advice on this. It shouldn't take longer than two hours of your time and we would be happy to clear it with Patricia, your department head, if necessary.
